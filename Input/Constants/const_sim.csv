dev;1;time step interpolation factor: 1,2,...,n (to keep sub-surface calculations stable)
dTsurf_ini;10;initial surface temperature step in search for EB=0 (C)
dz_ice;0.1;distance between vertical sub-surface levels (m)
z_max;40;maximum depth for sub-surface levels (m)
EB_max;0.1;surface temperature iteration will stop when the imbalance in the energy budget is less then EB_max (W/m2)
iter_max_EB;60;max number of iterations in reaching EB=0
iter_max_flux;20;max number of iterations in calculating flux profiles
L_dif;0.01;limit of relative change in Obukhov length during flux iterations
prec_cutoff;0;elevation below which there is half precipitation

RH_min;20;lowest possible relative humidity over snow&ice after extrapolating over the DEM (%)
WS_lim;1;wind speed below which turbulent fluxes are set to zero to prevent model instability (m/s)
rho_snow_scheme;0;choice of fresh snow density scheme
;; 0 = constant = 315; % Greenland-wide mean according to Fausto et al 201
;; 1 = dependant on mean temperature (Reeh et al. 2005)
;; 2 = dependant on mean temperature (Kuipers-Munneke et al. 2015)
;; 3 = dependant on elevation latitude and longitude (RSF unpub)
;; 4  dependant on hourly temperature and wind speed (Liston et al., 2007)
year;0;choice of year
precip_scheme;3;choice of precipitation scheme: 
;; 1 = when LRin_AWS >= c.sigma*T_AWS.^4, constant rate c.precip_rate (Dirk, unpub.)
;; 2 = when RH > 80%, with intensity scaled by (RH-80)/20, baseline rate c.precip_rate for 100% humidity (Liston and Sturm 1998)
;; 3 = Using surface height measurements (smoothed over 1 week) to quantify the snowfall
precip_rate ;0.001;
fresh_snow_dens;315; 
verbose;1;
solve_T_surf;1; if zero then observed surface temperature (from LRout) is used instead
perturb_rho_ini;0;allows to perturbate the initial density profile this shift will be applied on the upper 20 m of cores.
track_density;0; make the model save average top 20 m density at each time step along with the contributions from different processes
avoid_runoff;0; if 1 runoff is not allowed
THF_calc;1; choice of THF calculation
;; 1 = bulk
;; 2 = profile if possible
;; 3 = calculate both and save both results
track_temp;0; saves the firn temperature accross the different steps in the subsurface scheme
retmip;0; if one then uses the retmip forcing files
